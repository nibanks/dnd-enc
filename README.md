   - See "First-Time Setup" section below for detailed instructions

## Usage

## File Format

Adventures are stored in the `adventures/` directory as JSON files. The format is optimized for storage efficiency while remaining human-readable.

**Optimizations:**
- Field names shortened: `init` instead of `initiative`, `id` instead of `dndBeyondUrl`
- Empty values, zeros, and defaults are stripped
- Character IDs stored as numbers only (e.g., "159764903" instead of full URL)
- Player combatants identified by absence of `name` field
- Monster details looked up from D&D Beyond cache
- ~30% file size reduction compared to verbose format

**Simplified Structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "My Adventure",
  "chapters": ["Chapter 1", "Chapter 2"],
  "chapterNotes": {
    "Chapter 1": "Notes about this chapter..."
  },
  "players": [
    {
      "playerName": "John",
      "name": "Thorin Ironshield",
      "race": "Dwarf",
      "class": "Fighter",
      "level": 5,
      "maxHp": 48,
      "ac": 18,
      "dndBeyondUrl": "159764903"
    }
  ],
  "encounters": [
    {
      "name": "Boss Fight",
      "chapter": "Chapter 1",
      "state": "complete",
      "currentRound": 3,
      "combatants": [
        {
          "init": 15,
          "hp": 32,
          "maxHp": 48,
          "dmg": 12,
          "heal": 5,
          "id": "159764903",
          "ac": 18
        },
        {
          "name": "Cultist",
          "init": 12,
          "maxHp": 9,
          "dmg": 3
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Combatants with `id` but no `name` are players (looked up from players array)
- Combatants with `name` are monsters/NPCs (details from D&D Beyond cache)
- Fields with default values (0, empty string, etc.) are omitted
- App automatically restores full field names and URLs when loading

## Tips

- **D&D Beyond Cookies**: Cookies expire periodically. If monster fetching stops working, re-export and import fresh cookies
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - Ctrl+D for damage tracking (quick damage assignment between combatants)
  - Ctrl+H for healing tracking (track healing done)
  - Ctrl+Right Arrow for next turn (during active encounter)
  - Ctrl+Left Arrow for previous turn (during active encounter)
  - ESC to close any modal
- **Statistics Charts**: View campaign analytics on the main page showing initiative distributions, CR progression, and damage analysis

  - Unstarted: Full editing capability, setup mode
  - Started: Combat in progress, limited editing (HP, DMG, Heal, Notes)
  - Complete: Finished encounter, shown with green background, editable via ✏️ button
- **Chapter Organization**: Use chapters to organize encounters by story progression
- **Chapter Notes**: Add session notes, NPC information, or plot points to each chapter
- **XP Tracking**: Total XP is automatically calculated from monster CR values
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - ▶ arrow shows active turn
  - Red name indicates HP ≤ 0
  - Light green background for completed encounters
- **Monster Tooltips**: Hover over any monster name to see full stat block
- **Minimize Encounters**: Keep your interface clean by minimizing encounters you're not actively using

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites for both backend and frontend code.

### Quick Start

```powershell
# Run all tests (backend + frontend)
pytest && npm test
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Backend**: 34/34 core tests passing (6 D&D Beyond API tests skip without cookies)
- ✅ **Frontend**: 52/52 tests passing

### Test Suites

- **Backend Tests (pytest)**: Tests for Flask API endpoints, adventure management, PIN protection, session management, and caching
- **Frontend Tests (Jest)**: Tests for JavaScript logic, state management, calculations, DOM manipulation, and API integration

### Coverage

- **Backend**: Adventure CRUD, D&D Beyond cookie management, PIN protection, session management, caching, security
- **Frontend**: State management, XP calculations, HP tracking, modal interactions, API calls, error handling

### Optional: D&D Beyond Integration Tests

To enable the 6 skipped D&D Beyond API integration tests:
1. Set up cookies in the production app (via Settings)
2. Or run: `.\setup_cookies.ps1` to configure them manually

### Documentation

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed information on:
- Test setup and configuration
- Running specific tests
- Writing new tests
- Troubleshooting
- AI model integration

### For AI Models

Verify code changes don't break functionality:

```powershell
# Add Node.js to PATH (if needed in current session)
$env:Path += ';C:\Program Files\nodejs\'

# Run all tests
pytest && npm test
```

All tests should pass (except 6 D&D Beyond tests if cookies aren't configured).
